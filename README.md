# DataCamp
This repository serves two main purposes: 
  1) It provides me with another opportunity to practice managing a GitHub repository. After I finish each DataCamp Project, I hope to refresh my knowledge about pushing new files and commit to Github.
  2) This repo will also be a quick and easy place to go back and review my old work. Hopefully, as time goes by, I will be able to observe my progress in my coding abilities.
